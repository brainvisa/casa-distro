Common parameters:
==================
Most commands accept more or less the same parameters.

Many subcommands need :ref:`environment` selection specifications: :ref:`see the documentation on how to specify an environment <environment_options>`.

base_directory
    default= ``$HOME/casa_distro``

    Directory where images and environments are stored. This parameter
    can be passed on the commandline, or set via the
    ``CASA_BASE_DIRECTORY`` environment variable.

Commands:
=========


.. _casa-distro-help-help:

----
help
----
Print global help or help about a command.

Parameters
----------
format
    format help text in a given text format. Valid values are "text"
    (default) for raw text, or rst (RST/sphinx format).
full
    if ``true`` or ``yes`` or ``1``, display each subcommand parameters
    documentation in the general help.


.. _casa-distro-distro-help:

------
distro
------
List all available distro and provide information for each one.


.. _casa-distro-list-help:

----
list
----
List run or dev environments created by "setup"/"setup_dev" command.

Parameters
----------
:ref:`type <env_type>`
    default=None

    If given, select environment having the given type.
:ref:`distro`
    default=None

    If given, select environment having the given distro name.
:ref:`branch`
    default=None

    If given, select environment having the given branch.
:ref:`system`
    default=None

    If given, select environments having the given system name.
:ref:`image_version`
    default=None

    If given, select environments having the given image version.
:ref:`name <env_name>`
    default=None

    If given, select environment by its name. It replaces type, distro,
    branch and system and is shorter to select one.
base_directory
    default= ``$HOME/casa_distro``

    Directory where images and environments are stored. This parameter
    can be passed on the commandline, or set via the
    ``CASA_BASE_DIRECTORY`` environment variable.
json
    default = no
    The output is written as a list of configuration dictionaries in
    JSON format.
verbose
    default=None

    Print more detailed information if value is ``yes``, ``true`` or ``1``.


.. _casa-distro-run-help:

---
run
---
Start any command in a selected run or dev environment

example::

    casa_distro branch=master ls -als /casa

Parameters
----------
:ref:`type <env_type>`
    default=None

    If given, select environment having the given type.
:ref:`distro`
    default=None

    If given, select environment having the given distro name.
:ref:`branch`
    default=None

    If given, select environment having the given branch.
:ref:`system`
    default=None

    If given, select environments having the given system name.
:ref:`image_version`
    default=None

    If given, select environments having the given image version.
:ref:`name <env_name>`
    default=None

    If given, select environment by its name. It replaces type, distro,
    branch and system and is shorter to select one.
version
    If given, select environment by its version (only applicable to user
    environments, not dev)
base_directory
    default= ``$HOME/casa_distro``

    Directory where images and environments are stored. This parameter
    can be passed on the commandline, or set via the
    ``CASA_BASE_DIRECTORY`` environment variable.
gui
    default=True

    If ``no``, ``false`` or ``0``, command is not using a graphical user
    interface (GUI). Nothing is done to connect the container to a
    graphical interface. This option may be necessary in context where
    a graphical interface is not available.
opengl
    default=auto

    Setup different ways of trying to use OpenGL 3D rendering and GPU.
    ``auto``, ``container``, ``nv``, or ``software``.

    * ``auto``: use a heuristic to choose the best option that is safe
      based on the host configuration
    * ``container``: passes no special options to Singularity: the mesa
      installed in the container is used
    * ``nv`` tries to mount the proprietary NVidia driver of the host (linux)
      system in the container
    * ``software`` sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use a software-only OpenGL
      rendering. This solution is the slowest but is a fallback when no
      other solution works.
root
    default=False

    If ``yes``, ``true`` or ``1``, start execution as system administrator. For
    Singularity container, this requires administrator privileges on host
    system.
cwd
    Set current working directory to the given value before launching
    the command. By default, it is the same working directory as on the
    host
env
    Comma separated list of environment variables to pass to the command.
    Each variable must have the form name=value.
:ref:`image`
    Force usage of a specific virtual image instead of the one defined
    in the environment configuration.
container_options
    Comma separated list of options to add to the command line used to
    call the container system.
verbose
    default=None

    Print more detailed information if value is ``yes``, ``true`` or ``1``.


.. _casa-distro-pull-image-help:

----------
pull_image
----------
Update the container images. By default all images that are used by at
least one environment are updated. There are two ways of selecting the
image(s) to be downloaded:

1. filtered by environment, using the ``name`` selector, or a combination
   of ``distro``, ``branch``, and ``image_version``.

       casa_distro pull_image type=dev image_version=5.0

2. directly specifying an image name (*not* including bulild_number),
   e.g.::

       casa_distro pull_image image=casa-run-5.0.sif

Note that even though the build number does not appear in the local image
name, this command will always pull the image with the highest
build_number, e.g. the image that is named casa-dev-5.0-1.sif on the server
will be downloaded to a file named casa-dev-5.0.sif.

    can be passed on the commandline, or set via the
    ``CASA_BASE_DIRECTORY`` environment variable.

    Force usage of a specific virtual image instead of the one defined
    in the environment configuration.
